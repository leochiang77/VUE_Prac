接下來，我會分享部分我參與過的專案
Next, I will share some of the projects I have been involved in.
===============
這是用來傳送廢棄物的輸送機台，物品會卡在轉角處，一旦卡住了人就需要過來處理
This is a conveyor machine used for transporting waste. Waste may get stuck at this corner. Once it gets stuck, someone needs to come over to handle it.
So they hope to have a system that can automatically detect blockages, allowing personnel to avoid having to check regularly.

- The first point of consideration is what to use for detection. IMage? voice?
Deployment environment. Since it is in an open space, it will be affected by sunlight.
Affected by the environment.
受到陽光照射的影響,

- Frequency of abnormal occurrences異常發生的頻率
In this case, it occurs once every two hours on average. it's not hard to collect error data. Supervised learning

- Who is responsible for judging the anomalies?谁負責評斷異常?
由人所評斷, 所以要將訊號轉為更貼近實際人所聽到的聲音
It is judged by humans, so the signals need to be converted into sounds what people actually hear. 
We tend to pay more attention to low-frequency sounds. 所以這裡我使用MFCC方法，然後接續ENSEMBLE mutiple MODEL to predict

- 另外，用同樣手法參加2023年的比賽，藉咳嗽聲音來進行病症的分類，從370對中獲得第3名
before last year, I used this concept to participate the competition, classifying diseases based on cough sounds, and achieved third place out of 370 entries.
==============

Defect detection: First of all, these photos come from Google.
瑕疵檢測, 首先這些照片的來源是google

We produce a flawless image using stitching, and then subtract the two to highlight the defect areas.
我們用拼接的方式產出沒有瑕疵的圖片，並將兩者相減，凸顯出瑕疵的部分

- Model Choose? Resnet, DenseNet, Inception
特徵簡單，直接建立5層神經網路，減低系統的負擔。工具很重要，但解決問題更重要
The features are simple, so I didn't use a complex model. Instead, I directly built a 5-layer neural network to reduce the system's burden.

- In this case. the clear images is everything. 最重要的是，清楚的原圖才是一切
Compared to using complex image processing, my experience shows. maybe add a mask or a backlight would have a good performance.
無論做多少影像處理，不如直接加個遮罩或背光源

- 多少的準確度才夠?
How much accuracy is enough?
Our accuracy can reach 98%. However, this is still not enough.So my approach is to send any photos with doubts for manual interpretation.
98%? 99%? 只要有疑慮的都人工判讀，但對現場人員原本要判100片降低為10片
Even so, the number of photos requiring manual interpretation can still be reduced from 100 to 10.

==============

- 能源管理系統
這個產品主要協助客戶可以依循ISO50001認證標準進行能源管理
This product primarily assists customers in implementing energy management according to the ISO 50001 standard.
這是一個成功的產品，原因很簡單，他有賣到台積電，每年帶來數千萬的收益
This is a successful product for a simple reason: it has been sold to TSMC, generating tens of millions in revenue each year.
這產品的主要由多個控制項組成，我主要負責NOSQL資料庫的建立，及前端UI UX的開發
(This product is mainly composed of multiple control elements.) I am responsible for establishing the NoSQL database and developing the UI/UX, the control elements related machine learning.

Why was this product chosen?
- The key point is to consistently exceed customer expectations.關鍵點是不斷地超乎客戶預期
他們想要能源報表，我們就給他可自行編輯的網頁
They wanted energy dashborad, so we provided them with a web page that they could edit on their own.
We can customize the data they want to see.
他們想要機台耗電資料，我們就提供讓他們可以針對機台狀態進行分群的功能
They wanted data on machine power consumption, so we provided a function that allows them to cluster based on the machine's status.
Conduct comparisons of the machines.

這也導致我現在習慣不斷地思考下一步，什麼才是他們真正的需求

Of course, it is not new stuff, but these are my profound personal experiences.
- 當然這很多人都知道，但程式碼模組化, 與客戶的交流是我的親身經驗

==============
What I am currently doing the most is still going back to the data itself.
那我現在做最多的，還是回到資料本身
- 將資料定義、指標統一 (ex: 效益開始計算的時間)
Standardize and Unify the data definitions and metrics between different factories.

如果有任何工廠想開始作智慧工廠，我都強烈建議先從這項目開始，因為這是無論在任何階段 資料和指標都會使用到

- 這其實不容易且範圍很大，需要不斷地溝通和全面的考量和技術
This is actually not easy and covers a wide range; it requires constant communication, comprehensive consideration, and technology.

Here are the front-end and back-end technologies I have used. Actually, each component could be an independent position.
這是前後端所利用到的技術，每一塊其實都可以是獨立的職位，中間是我比較熟悉的, 外側大約是中等
IIS -> MySQL, SQLite -> Python(Flask, FastAPI, Django, RESTfulAPI) -> JS, HTML, CSS (Vue.js)
Docker, Postgres, Oracle, NoSQL(Cassandra, Kairosdb), C#, ASP, Nodejs, Reactjs
Hadoop , AWS, Azure, ML, DL

---------------------------------------------

Thanks for the time to xxx me. i gonna share my basic infomation and a couple of projects i have involved in.
The first page. on left side is my working experience. i have 3 years experience in software development, and i am working as software engineer in xxx since 2020. on right side is my education and log-term program i attended. Big Data program is about NOSQL database and distributed file system such as hadoop, Spark. AI academy the courses involved ML, DL, and my final project is Donkey Car which combine image recognition with edge computing. This is a photo when I was in military duty. work as engineer in Haiti.
=====
The first project i gonna show. there is a conveyor  machine used for trasporting waste. Waste may get stuck at this corner. Once it gets stuck, someone needs to come over to handle it. so they want to build a system to automatically detect blockages.
so the first question i ask myself. what to use for detection. The Deployment environment is in an open space, it would be affected by sunlight. therefore, i chose voice to classify.
Who is responsible for judging the abnormal data? Specifically, It is judged by humans's ear, so the signals need to be converted into sounds what we really hear. in general, We tend to pay more attention to low-frequency sounds. therefore, i used method [mel frequency] to close to what we really hear. Then, built multiple models. Ensemble them predict result.
i also used similar concept to attend the competition, classifying different diseases based on coughing sounds. fortunately, i got third place out of 370 entries
=====
This is the classic case. Defect classification. fist of all, all the pictures are from google, so there is no secrete here.
About Image rpcess, i generate flawless image by using stitching. move clean part to cover the defect area. then, subtract two images to highlight defect feature. and we can observe the featues is simple, theresfore rather than using complex model(Resnet,..), i directly build 5-layer neural network to predict results. 
In this case, Clear images is everything. Compare to using complex method to process images, add a shelter or a backlight on-site would get a better performance
next question i have been asked many times. How much accuracy is enough? 80?90?99?, even 100 there would be somone ask me is there any exception? i replied: yes, absoluted. so my approach is send any photo with doubts for manual interpretation. the actual benefit should be the number of interpretation reduce from 100 to 10. save time by 90%. 
=====
this slide i wanna show a successful product i participated in.  
it primarily assist customer to implement energy management according to ISO standard. i am in charge of the NoSQL database, user interface, and machine learning's control item.
Why do I say it is successful? because it's been sold to TSMC and other companies, generating tens of millions NTD per year.
What inspirations have I got from this process? the key point is constantly exceed expectation of customers. they wanna energy dashboard, we provide them with funcitonal web page they can edit on their own.
they wanna power comsumption data to analyze, we provide them with ML function to cluster.
As a result, the customers' confidence continues to grow, and they are more willing to tell us the real demand.
i know it is not new stuff, but it is my profound personal experience.
i also apply this way of thinking to my development work.

====
this is the last page, After completing multiple projects, What I am currently doing is still going back to the data itself.
Divided into two aspects, in terms of management. Ultimately, it still returns to effectiveness. it is necessary to standardize and unify the data definitions and metrics across different factories. 
而就效益層面，原本的模式是 工程師需定期將原始資料貼到EXCEL計算，將計算結果繪圖。而現在這些工作我都用程式自動化執行並視覺化，只要打開瀏覽器，就可以看到想要的數據。概念很直觀卻非常有效
In terms of effectiveness, the original model required engineers to regularly find raw data, paste them into Excel for calculations and create charts.
Now, I have automated  all these tasks and visualized on web site. all they need to do is open the browser to see the desired data. 
The concept is very straightforward yet highly effective.
Below are the skills i uesd. from database design, RESTful API . connect backend to frontend web page. In the end deploy on web service. I believe these capacities can bring contributions to the company
